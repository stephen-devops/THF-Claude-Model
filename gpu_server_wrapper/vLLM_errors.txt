vLLM exposing an LLM

 The Reality:

  Mistral 7B (7 billion parameters) is too small for complex function calling/tool use required by your Wazuh agent. It works for simple text generation but struggles with:        
  - Structured JSON generation
  - Multi-step ReAct reasoning
  - OpenSearch DSL query syntax
  - Following tool schemas precisely

  Your original Mistral Large 2 (123B) would handle this perfectly but doesn't fit in 4x 40GB A100s.

Your Options:

  1. Stick with Claude Sonnet 4.5 (works perfectly, costs money)
  2. Try a quantized Mistral Large (4-bit or 8-bit - would fit in memory)
  3. Try Mistral-Nemo-12B or similar (middle ground between 7B and 123B)
  4. Accept Mistral 7B limitations and manually handle errors
